# Algorithms  

## Algorithms study group :books:
This is a 9 weeks algorithms study group with some friends and we will go over the essential information about algorithms, data structures covering basic iterable data types, sorting, and searching algorithms.

###Data Structures

#### Week 1. HashTable and LinkedList (Big O and Implementation) 

#### Week 2. Stack and Queues (Big O and Implementation)

#### Week 3. Vectors and ArrayList (Big O and Implementation)
- *Problem:* Compress a given string "aabbbccc" to "a2b3c3" 
- *Constraint:* Inplace compression, no extra space to be used 
- *Assumption:* Output size will not exceed input size.. ex input:"abb" -> "a1b2" buffer overflow.. such inputs will not be given.

#### Week 4. Tries and Binary Trees (Big O and Implementation)


###Algorithms

#### Week 6. Quick Sort and Merge Sort (Big O and Implementation)

#### Week 7. Tree operations (Insert, Find, Delete)

#### Week 8. Depth First Search (Big O and Implementation)

#### Week 9. Breadth First Search (Big O and Implementation)


## Algorithms-Part I (Princeton University) :mortar_board:
Some code exercises of the course

## Job interview questions :scream_cat:
This is a summary of the questions we got in a number of in-person interviews with a range of companies. 

## Random :ghost:
Random code, random algorithms
